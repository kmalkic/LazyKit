/*!
* @function lazy_main_dispatch_async
*
* @abstract
* Submits a block for asynchronous execution on a dispatch queue.
*
* @discussion
* The dispatch_async() function is the fundamental mechanism for submitting
* blocks to a dispatch queue.
*
* Calls to dispatch_async() always return immediately after the block has
* been submitted, and never wait for the block to be invoked.
*
* The target queue determines whether the block will be invoked serially or
* concurrently with respect to other blocks submitted to that same queue.
* Serial queues are processed concurrently with respect to each other.
*
* @param block
* The block to submit to the target dispatch queue. This function performs
* Block_copy() and Block_release() on behalf of callers.
* The result of passing NULL in this parameter is undefined.
